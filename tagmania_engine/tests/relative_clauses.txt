I'm looking for a secretary who can use a computer well.
She has a son that is a doctor.
We bought a house which is 200 years old.
I sent a letter which arrived three weeks later.
The people that live on the island are very friendly.
The man who phoned is my brother.
The camera which costs Â£100 is over there.
The house that belongs to Julie is in London.
